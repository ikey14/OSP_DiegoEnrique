	Exit and Err Msg	Y

	Info			Y

	Bytemaps		Y

	Dir			Y

	Rename			Y

	Remove(Multiblock)	Y

	Print(Multiblock)	Y

	Copy(Multiblock)	Y (Weird)	There is a weird issue with the Copy command.
						When printing a copy of a file, nothing prints,
						But all the blocks were copied correctly, and
						the print function is looking in the right blocks.
						However, if we exit the program and then start it again,
						now the new file can be printed. It has to do with
						the "memdatos" pointer, but cause and fix haven't been found.
						Other than this, it works perfectly.
